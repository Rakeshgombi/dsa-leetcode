    "# Quick Sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This process continues until the base case of an empty array or an array with a single element is reached, which is inherently sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Quick Sort](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:560/format:webp/1*1OXQp3jbpyUJHYMX5rrJOQ.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## steps:\n",
    "1. Choose a pivot element from the array. This can be done in various ways, such as selecting the first element, the last element, the middle element, or using a random element.\n",
    "2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one containing elements less than the pivot and the other containing elements greater than the pivot.\n",
    "3. Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-arrays until the base case is reached (an array of zero or one element).\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick sort has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n), making it efficient for large datasets. However, its worst-case performance can degrade to O(n²) if the smallest or largest element is always chosen as the pivot, which can be mitigated by using better pivot selection strategies.\n"
