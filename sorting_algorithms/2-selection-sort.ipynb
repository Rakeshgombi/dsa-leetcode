    "Selection sort works by splitting the input array into two parts: the list of numbers being built, from smallest to largest, and the remainder numbers that have yet to be sorted. Selection sort __finds the smallest number from the unsorted list, and places it at the end of the sorted one__. Rinse and repeat.\n",

    "With a big O notation of O(n²), selection sort is another algorithm that is not very effective for sorting large arrays. While slightly outperforming bubble sort when working with small lists, selection sort is still viewed as a very slow algorithm.\n",
