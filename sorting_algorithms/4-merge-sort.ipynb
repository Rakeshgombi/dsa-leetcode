    "# Merge Sort\n",
    "Merge Sort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts them, and then merges the sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Merge Sort Animation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/format:webp/1*opwN0BhtH4zvPF697fPlow.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. Divide the array into two halves.\n",
    "2. Recursively sort each half.\n",
    "3. Merge the two sorted halves to produce the final sorted array.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's take an example array: `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]`\n",
    "1. Divide the array into two halves: `[12, 11, 13]` and `[5, 6, 7]`\n",
    "2. Recursively sort each half:\n",
    "   - `[12, 11, 13]` -> `[11, 12, 13]`\n",
    "   - `[5, 6, 7]` -> `[5, 6, 7]`\n",
    "3. Merge the two sorted halves: `[11, 12, 13]` and `[5, 6, 7]` -> `[5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13]`\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:560/format:webp/1*vFISt_9pO-eEJl13nOAsMg.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "The time complexity of Merge Sort is O(n log n) in all cases (worst, average, and best) because the array is always divided into two halves and each half is sorted recursively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "The space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n) because it requires additional space to store the temporary arrays used for merging.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Merge Sort is an efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm. It is suitable for large datasets and is often used in external sorting algorithms where data cannot fit into memory."
