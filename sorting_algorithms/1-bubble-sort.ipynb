    "Bubble sort cycles through the array of numbers, and looks at each pair of adjacent numbers. Bubble sort will then place the lower number on the left, towards the beginning of the array, and the higher number on the right, towards the end. This process is repeated and bubble sort will continue to loop through the array until no swaps are made, thus leaving a sorted array.\n",

    "The name of this sorting algorithm is derived from the way smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list (beginning of the array) while larger elements sink to the bottom (end of the array). The algorithm repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n",
