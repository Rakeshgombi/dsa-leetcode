    "# Insertion Sort\n",
    "Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. The algorithm will iterate through the initial array, remove one element, and place it in its proper place as a part of the sorted list.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Insertion Sort Animation](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:600/format:webp/1*bmfRxyIQZEK0Iu5T6YV1sw.gif)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Steps\n",
    "1. Start from the second element (index 1) and compare it with the elements before it.\n",
    "2. If the current element is smaller than the compared element, shift the compared element one position to the right.\n",
    "3. Repeat the process until you find the correct position for the current element and insert it there.\n",
    "4. Move to the next element and repeat the process until the entire array is sorted.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "Let's take an example array: `[12, 11, 13, 5, 6]`\n",
    "1. Start with the second element (11):\n",
    "   - Compare 11 with 12, since 11 < 12, shift 12 to the right.\n",
    "   - Insert 11 at the correct position: `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n",
    "2. Move to the next element (13):\n",
    "   - Compare 13 with 12, since 13 > 12, it is already\n",
    "    in the correct position: `[11, 12, 13, 5, 6]`\n",
    "3. Move to the next element (5):\n",
    "   - Compare 5 with 13, since 5 < 13, shift 13 to the right.\n",
    "    - Compare 5 with 12, since 5 < 12, shift 12 to the right.\n",
    "    - Compare 5 with 11, since 5 < 11, shift 11 to the right.\n",
    "    - Insert 5 at the correct position: `[5, 11, 12, 13, 6]`\n",
    "4. Move to the next element (6):\n",
    "   - Compare 6 with 13, since 6 < 13, shift 13 to the right.\n",
    "    - Compare 6 with 12, since 6 < 12, shift 12 to the right.\n",
    "    - Compare 6 with 11, since 6 < 11, shift 11 to the right.\n",
    "    - Insert 6 at the correct position: `[5, 6, 11, 12, 13]`\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Time Complexity\n",
    "The time complexity of Insertion Sort is O(n^2) in the worst and average cases, and O(n) in the best case when the array is already sorted. This is because in the worst case, each element needs to be compared with every other element before it, while in the best case, each element is compared only once.\n",
    "## Space Complexity\n",
    "The space complexity of Insertion Sort is O(1) because it is an in-place sorting algorithm that does not require any additional data structures to sort the array.\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "Insertion Sort is an efficient algorithm for sorting small datasets or partially sorted arrays. However, it is not suitable for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity. It is often used as a building block in more complex sorting algorithms, such as Timsort, which is used in Python's built-in sorting functions."
