    "# Big O Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O notation is a mathematical way to describe the **performance** or **complexity** of an algorithm. It specifically describes the worst-case scenario and helps us understand how the runtime or space requirements grow as the input size increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **O(1)** - Constant time: Performance doesn't change with input size\n",
    "- **O(log log n)** - Double logarithmic time: Extremely slow growth (e.g., interpolation search on uniformly distributed data)\n",
    "- **O(log n)** - Logarithmic time: Performance grows slowly (e.g., binary search)\n",
    "- **O(√n)** - Square root time: Between logarithmic and linear (e.g., primality testing)\n",
    "- **O(n)** - Linear time: Performance grows proportionally with input size\n",
    "- **O(n log n)** - Linearithmic time: Common in efficient sorting algorithms (e.g., merge sort, quicksort, heapsort)\n",
    "- **O(n²)** - Quadratic time: Performance grows with square of input (e.g., bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort)\n",
    "- **O(n³)** - Cubic time: Three nested loops (e.g., naive matrix multiplication)\n",
    "- **O(n⁴)** - Polynomial time: Multiple nested loops\n",
    "- **O(2ⁿ)** - Exponential time: Performance doubles with each addition to input (e.g., recursive Fibonacci, subset generation)\n",
    "- **O(n!)** - Factorial time: Grows extremely fast (e.g., brute-force traveling salesman problem, generating all permutations)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Big O helps developers:\n",
    "- Compare algorithm efficiency\n",
    "- Predict scalability issues\n",
    "- Make informed decisions about which algorithm to use\n",
    "- Optimize code for better performance"
